<h1>🛠 About Me</h1><br>
💻 I'm highly proficient in backend development using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Sequelize, and Mongoose. I’m also comfortable working with RESTful APIs, MVC architecture, Socket.IO, and microservices.<br><br>

🎨 On the frontend side, I’ve built applications using Angular, Vue.js, React.js, Next.js, Nuxt.js, and classic tools like HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript/jQuery.<br><br>

🚀 I have hands-on experience with AWS (EC2, S3, IAM) for deploying and managing cloud infrastructure, and I’ve integrated Redis and RabbitMQ for caching and messaging queues.<br><br>

🛡 I follow Agile methodologies, manage tasks using Jira, and collaborate with teams via Git. I’ve led teams of up to 15 developers and enjoy mentoring others and organizing projects.<br><br>

🧠 I’m also exploring low-code platforms like Neutrinos to expand my full-stack capabilities and stay ahead of the curve.<br><br>

⚙️ Bonus: I have experience with PHP Laravel, understand Node.js threading, and actively apply best practices in system performance and stability.<br>
